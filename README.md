# Pebket

A Pocket article reader for Pebble smartwatches.

This project is a formerly unreleased reader for articles saved to [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/), built for the Pebble smartwatch. Using Pocket's REST web API, it loads the user's saved articles on the user's smartphone, and streams them to a viewer on the Pebble.

This project is mostly functional, but it was never entirely finished. When the Pebble corporation went under and the Pebble Time 2 was cancelled, I decided to move on to other things.
